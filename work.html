        <h2>Welcome to my portfolio</h2>
        <p>Here is where I showcase the intersection of art and technology. With a background in oil painting and an Associate's in Art, my journey as both an artist and a developer has been driven by a passion to bridge creative expression with digital innovation. From my oil paintings, which reflect my deep appreciation for traditional artistry, to my work as a developer, where I explore how technology can enhance human creativity, my goal is to merge these two worlds. Whether through research on AI in education, creating digital tools for remote collaboration, or designing websites that engage users, I strive to create solutions that empower individuals to express themselves, collaborate, and innovate in meaningful ways. This portfolio represents my ongoing exploration of how art and technology can work together to shape a more creative and inclusive future.</p>

          <h2>Favorite Things</h2>
          <p>For this project, I used Figma and Adobe Illustrator to create a web composition that reflects my love for design. I developed a custom logo inspired by Gustav Klimt's iconic painting, The Kiss, aiming to capture its intimate, elegant energy. The design embraces warm tones, evoking a sense of coziness and sophistication, while maintaining a modern and cohesive aesthetic.</p>

          <h2>Acedemic Papers</h2>
          <p>As a developer focused on bridging art and technology, my work explores how digital tools can shape society. In my research on AI in education, I examine how tools like ChatGPT enhance learning by increasing accessibility and personalization, while also addressing challenges like plagiarism and ethical concerns. Similarly, my study on Information Systems in remote work highlights the role of tools like Zoom and Slack in improving productivity, while also emphasizing issues like the Digital Divide and unequal access to technology. Both projects reflect my commitment to developing innovative, inclusive solutions that empower creativity, foster collaboration, and address real-world challenges.</p>
