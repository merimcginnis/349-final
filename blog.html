        <h3>Creativity In The Unknown</h3>
        <p>In the article, "If you want to be creative, you can’t be certain - Embracing ambiguity as a superpower" by Ida Persson, a uniwue perspective on creative thinking arises. Persson describes how working as a designer there is a pressure to deliver face-paced work, but through experiences working at Ideo Ida found that embracing uncertainty was more successful. 
            <br><br>
            In my experiences as an artist, I’ve found that starting is often the hardest part. Over the years, I've developed a process I like to call the "Ugly Phase." What I mean by this is that sometimes, you just have to get something down on the page—whether in digital work or traditional fine art. The key is to move past perfectionism and embrace the messiness of the initial stages. After all, being able to identify what doesn’t work is just as valuable as knowing what does. It's all part of the creative journey. If you would like to read Persson's article click the link below!</p><br>

        <h3>I am Making Art</h3>
        <p>I had an appointment with my dermatologist a few weeks ago, and I noticed a some things: 1)I was by far the youngest person in the waiting room. 2) Older people go to doctor visits together, and it's very endearing. 3) Waiting in the lobby feels like one of the longest times in your life.          
            <br><br>
            In the article “The Art of Waiting” by Rodrigo S-C, the author shares his personal experience at the doctor's office. As you might expect, Rodrigo mentions that patients usually keep to themselves and spend time on their phones, which is why he does the exact opposite. Inspired by a two-minute video of artist John Baldessari, in which he strikes small poses in front of a blank wall and shouts “I am making art” repeatedly, Rodrigo is motivated to pass the time by taking photos of ordinary items around the office, claiming them as art. One thing that stood out to me while reading this was that the author mentioned that artists are the best at killing time. </p><br>
